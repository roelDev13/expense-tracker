# Expense Tracker

## Overview
This project's objective was to learn the use of different React Hooks(state, effect, reducer, etc...) and their applications, as well as the implementation of the Context API for passing data. This expense tracker allows the user to set and edit a budget, in which the user can add "items" and their costs in order to see if all added costs of the items exceed or don't the budgets limit. This project was built using React, Bootsrap, and HTML.

## Setting Up
Before starting up the application, we are going to need to install our dependencies with:
```md
# Install required dependencies
npm install
```

After doing the last step, we can begin typing the next line into our terminal to start running our app:
```md
npm start
```

## Getting started  

You can visit the page made with github pages here:
https://roeldev13.github.io/expense-tracker/

You will be greeted with some fixed values allready put inside the expense tracker, but you can edit and delete these if you wish.

From here on out, you can start playing around with all of the values and see if they exceed your budget.
